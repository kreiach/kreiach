Hello, I'm Kyle. By day, I lead a team implementing microservices architecture for a prominent financial services organization. During my free time, I run a YouTube channel dedicated to documenting and teaching programming for a 45+ year old 8-bit architecture using assembly language. Join me as I explore the fascinating world of vintage computing and share my knowledge with others passionate about programming and technology.
